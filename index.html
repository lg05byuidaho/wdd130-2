            <p>Hello, I'm Guelson Laguerre, I'm from Grand’anse, Haiti. 
                I like to play soccer every Saturday morning with my friends and brothers. 
                I enjoy spending my time in reading and learning all that is good. 
                I work as an IT Assistant in an organization in my home area. 
                I learned to love technology and my biggest goal is to make a good career in this field. 
                Pursuing my studies at BYU Pathway Worldwide remains a great source of blessing for me and my family. 
                I am really glad to talk about myself in this short message.</p>
