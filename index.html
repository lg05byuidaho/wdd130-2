                <p>Hello, I'm Guelson Laguerre, I'm from Grand’anse, Haiti. I have been a member of 
                    The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for over 21 years. 
                    I had the privilege of serving a full-time mission for 2 years. 
                    After returning from the mission, I continued to study and experience my work in the city of Jeremie
                    I like to play soccer every Saturday morning with my friends and brothers. 
                    I enjoy spending my time in reading and learning all that is good. 
                    I work as an IT Assistant in an organization in my home area. 
                    I learned to love technology and my biggest goal is to make a good career in this field. 
                    Pursuing my studies at BYU Pathway Worldwide remains a great source of blessing for me and my family. 
                    I am really glad to talk about myself in this short message.</p>
